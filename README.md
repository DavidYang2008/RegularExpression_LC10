# Recursive Matching Regular Expression

# Problem to solve

Implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.

'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

The function prototype should be:
bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)

Some examples:
isMatch("aa","a") → false

isMatch("aa","aa") → true

isMatch("aaa","aa") → false

isMatch("aa", "a*") → true

isMatch("aa", ".*") → true

isMatch("ab", ".*") → true

isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") → true


# Solution

Use a recursive program. 

One tricky thing is to effciently and correctly handle the case that "." and "*" are repeated and mixed together, like "..*..****.".
